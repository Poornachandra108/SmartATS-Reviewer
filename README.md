# SmartATS Reviewer: Gemini LLM Powered Resume Analyzer ✨

An AI-Powered Resume Review System using Google Generative AI (Gemini) & Streamlit.

## 📖 Project Overview

Job hunting can be overwhelming — especially when rejection emails come without feedback.  
This inspired me to build *SmartATS Reviewer* — an intelligent application that helps job seekers analyze their resumes against job descriptions and provides actionable feedback.

By leveraging Google's Gemini Pro AI, this tool reviews resumes just like an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) would — and guides users on how to improve their profiles for better shortlisting chances.
